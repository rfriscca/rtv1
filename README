You can create objects by creating a file

Axis : x = up, y = right, z = depth

objects that can be created :

camera
spot
sphere
plane
cone
cylinder

You have to create at least one camera
(can't have multiple camera so the last one created will be the camera),
one spot and another object

You can apply differents transformations to one object, here is what you can do

t(0, 0, 1) => translation can be applied to all objects

r(0, 90, 0) => rotation (in degrees) rotate an object can be applied to
camera, plane, cone, cylinder

c(255, 0, 255) => color of the spot, for the other objects color goes from 0 to 1
(coefficient of absorption) : example for a sphere c(0.1, 1, 0.8), color can't be
applied to camera

o0.2 => radius of sphere / cone / cylinder

summary :

camera : t / r
spot : t / c
sphere : t / c / o
plane : t / r / c
cone : t / r / c / o
cylinder : t / r / c / o
